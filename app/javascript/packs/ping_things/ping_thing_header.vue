    <h1>Ping Thing</h1>
    <p>
      We use this Ping Thing to&nbsp;show recent transaction confirmation times on the&nbsp;Solana blockchain.
      The&nbsp;<a href='https://www.blocklogic.net' target='_blank'>Block Logic Validator</a> plus several other
      validators are sending simple transfer transactions every 15&nbsp;seconds and the&nbsp;confirmation times appear
      below. You can use these pings as a&nbsp;gauge of&nbsp;cluster performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      All data is available for download from our <a href="/api-documentation">REST&nbsp;API</a>. App developers, you can
      also upload your own TX&nbsp;confirmation times. Any Solana application or transaction type is allowed. Use this
      tool to&nbsp;show recent confirmation times to&nbsp;your users. See GitHub for our reference <a href='https://github.com/Block-Logic/ping-thing-client' target='_blank'>Ping Thing Client</a>.
