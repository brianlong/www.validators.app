    <p>
      We use this Ping Thing to show recent transaction confirmation times on the Solana blockchain. All confirmation times &amp; slot latencies are measured end-to-end using our JS <a href='https://github.com/Block-Logic/ping-thing-client' target='_blank'>Ping Thing Client</a> to send pings from data centers. You can use these pings as a gauge of latency to the leader.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be aware that your ability to land transactions in a timely manner depends heavily on your TX quality (CU budget &amp; Priority Fees). If your TXs stats are significantly higher than ours, check your CU budget &amp; Priority Fees!
    </p>

    <p>
      All data is available for download from our <a href="/api-documentation">REST API</a>. You can also upload your own pings and compare your latencies to ours. See GitHub for our reference <a href='https://github.com/Block-Logic/ping-thing-client' target='_blank'>Ping Thing Client</a>.
