<h2 class="mb-5">Basics</h2>

<h3 class="h5" id="staking">What is staking</h3>
<div class="mb-5">
  <p>
    <strong>Staking</strong> is the&nbsp;process of delegating your sols to&nbsp;one or more validators, who process
    transactions and run the&nbsp;network. Validators who have more stake delegated&nbsp;to are more likely to&nbsp;write
    transactions and gain more rewards while doing&nbsp;so. Delegators then get proportional amount of&nbsp;rewards
    reduced by the&nbsp;validators <a href="#commission">commission</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep in&nbsp;mind that staking brings&nbsp;up a&nbsp;risk of a&nbsp;process known as slashing. If any intentional
    malicious behaviour is detected for a&nbsp;validator, some amount of stake delegated to it can be destroyed.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to&nbsp;start dalegating your SOL tokens, it is necessery to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;separate stake account and
    choose a&nbsp;validator to delegate to. You can do it either from <a href="https://docs.solana.com/cli">command line interface</a>
    or by using one of the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide">supported wallets</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 class="h5" id="timeline">Staking timeline</h3>
<div class="mb-5">
  <p>
    After you delegate your SOL tokens, you need to&nbsp;wait until the&nbsp;next <a href="#epoch">epoch</a> for
    the&nbsp;changes to&nbsp;take effect. Throughout the&nbsp;epoch validator is voting and generates new transactions
    according to the&nbsp;leader schedule and only after one entire epoch ends, the reward is added to your staking pool
    and is automatically delegated to the&nbsp;same validator.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that during the&nbsp;pending epoch your tokens cannot be withdrawn.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you wish to undelegate your tokens from the&nbsp;validator, you need to&nbsp;wait untill the end of the&nbsp;epoch.
    In this case your last reward will be added to&nbsp;your stake account and will no longer be delegated.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 class="h5" id="choosing-validator">Choosing the&nbsp;right validator</h3>
<div class="mb-5">
  <p>
    There are a&nbsp;couple of things to&nbsp;consider while choosing the&nbsp;right validator to&nbsp;delegate your
    stake&nbsp;to. In order to be able to vote properly and create new transactions it needs to&nbsp;have constant high
    speed network access and good overall performance. Another important thing is the&nbsp;<a href="#commission">commission</a>
    validator takes to&nbsp;cover it's costs - the&nbsp;less the better. You should also check if validator is credible
    and operates in a&nbsp;transparent manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Performance</strong> - we're gathering some statistical data to&nbsp;determine how well the validator operates
    within solana network. <a href="#root-distance">Root block distance</a> and <a href="#vote-distance">vote distance</a>
    show how far behind it is from the&nbsp;top of the&nbsp;blockchain while <a href="#skipped-vote">the skipped slot &percnt;</a>
    measures the&nbsp;percent of the&nbsp;time that a&nbsp;leader fails to&nbsp;produce a&nbsp;block during their
    allocated slots.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Commission</strong> - The&nbsp;important thing to&nbsp;notice here is that commissions can be changed in any
    moment, so it's crucial to&nbsp;check for particular validators
    <%= link_to "commission change history", commission_histories_path(network: params[:network]) %> and see if
    there's no malicious behaviour there. Some of the&nbsp;validators are offering 0% commission as an&nbsp;introductory
    offer. It's a&nbsp;good idea to&nbsp;contact them to&nbsp;see when the&nbsp;offer expires and the&nbsp;new rate
    at that time.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Reliability</strong> - if the&nbsp;validator has all the&nbsp;information filled up, has its own website and
    no malicious behaviour in the&nbsp;past is detected it is more likely that it cares about reliability and thus is
    more trustworthy.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 class="h5" id="score">How Does the&nbsp;Validator Score V1 Work?</h3>
<div class="mb-5">
  <p>
    We track validator performance over several dimensions and assign a&nbsp;score in the&nbsp;range of (0..2) for each.
    The&nbsp;scores also correlate with colored icons: <i class="fas fa-circle score-2"></i> is excellent,
    <i class="fas fa-circle score-1"></i> is OK, and <i class="fas fa-circle score-0"></i> means there is room for
    improvement. The&nbsp;scored dimensions are:
  </p>

  <ol class="list-with-numbers">
    <li>
      <strong>Root Block Distance</strong> <br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-2 mr-1"></i> (2 points) means that the&nbsp;validator median block distance is at,
      or below, the&nbsp;cluster median.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-1 mr-1"></i> (1 point) means that the&nbsp;validator average block distance is at,
      or below, the&nbsp;cluster average.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-0 mr-1"></i> (0 points) means that the&nbsp;validator average is higher than
      the&nbsp;cluster average.<br />
      The&nbsp;medians and averages are calculated over a&nbsp;trailing 2-day period and do not reset with each epoch.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Vote Distance</strong> The&nbsp;scoring rules are the&nbsp;same as Root Block Distance above.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Skipped Slot &percnt;</strong> <br />
      For this metric, we track a&nbsp;trailing 24-hour moving average of the&nbsp;skip rate. The moving average (MA) is
      then compared to the cluster median(MA) and cluster average(MA). On the&nbsp;charts, a&nbsp;dotted line shows
      the&nbsp;spot reading that resets with every epoch. The solid line shows the 24-hour moving average.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-2 mr-1"></i> (2 points) means that the&nbsp;validator skipped slot &percnt; is at, or below,
      the&nbsp;cluster median.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-1 mr-1"></i> (1 point) means that the&nbsp;skipped slot &percnt; is at, or below,
      the&nbsp;cluster average.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-0 mr-1"></i> (0 points) means that the&nbsp;validator average is higher than
      the&nbsp;cluster average.<br />
      The&nbsp;moving averages reflect the&nbsp;previous 24-hours, and the&nbsp;spot reading resets with each new epoch.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Published Information</strong><br />
      Investors or delegators want to&nbsp;know who is running a&nbsp;node. The&nbsp;Published Information Score measures
      the&nbsp;contact information that the&nbsp;validator has posted to the&nbsp;blockchain using the
      `solana validator-info` feature.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-2 mr-1"></i> (2 points) means that the&nbsp;validator has published all four data
      elements (Name, Keybase ID, Website URL, and Details).<br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-1 mr-1"></i> (1 point) means that the&nbsp;validator has published two or three parts.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-0 mr-1"></i> (0 points) means that the&nbsp;validator has published only one, or zero,
      pieces of contact data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Software Version</strong><br />
      This score is based on the&nbsp;Solana software version currently in use on this node.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-2 mr-1"></i> (2 points) means that the&nbsp;validator is using the&nbsp;correct major,
      minor, & patch versions.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-1 mr-1"></i> (1 point) means that the&nbsp;validator is using the&nbsp;correct major,
      &&nbsp;minor versions (but not patch).<br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-0 mr-1"></i> (0 points) means that the&nbsp;validator is only using the&nbsp;current
      major version (or less).<br />
      This score is updated as soon as the&nbsp;validator starts voting with a&nbsp;new software update.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Security Report</strong><br />
      Security and operations are a&nbsp;critical component of a&nbsp;well-run validator. I am assigning one (1) point
      when a&nbsp;validator has provided me with a&nbsp;URL to their web page related to&nbsp;security policies. Please
      be aware that I am not evaluating the&nbsp;content on that web page. I will merely confirm that the&nbsp;web page
      discusses security or operating procedures before posting the&nbsp;link to this site.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-1 mr-1"></i> (1 point) means that the&nbsp;validator has provided a&nbsp;valid URL.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-0 mr-1"></i> (0 points) means that the&nbsp;validator has not published a&nbsp;description
      of their security policies.<br />
      (Validators, please directly <%= link_to 'contact Brian Long', contact_us_path %> to provide the&nbsp;URL.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Stake Concentration</strong> is a&nbsp;contra-score and will DEDUCT points from a&nbsp;validator's total score:<br />
      <i class="fas fa-minus-circle text-warning mr-1"></i> (-2 points) means that this validator is one of
      the&nbsp;top 33&percnt; active stake holders.<br />
      The&nbsp;concentration of stake is a&nbsp;bad thing on a&nbsp;decentralized proof-of-stake blockchain. There is
      no deduction of points, and no icon, if the validator controls less than 3%. If you are an investor who is
      delegating stake, please consider high performing nodes without high stake concentrations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data Center Concentration</strong><br />
      This is another contra-score that will DEDUCT points from validators located in data centers that host a&nbsp;high
      percentage of other Solana validators. A&nbsp;high data center concentration means that a&nbsp;problem with
      the&nbsp;hosting provider could take many of the&nbsp;nodes offline.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-minus-circle text-danger mr-1"></i> (-2 points) means that this validator is in a&nbsp;data center
      with a&nbsp;very high percent of the active stake.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-minus-circle text-warning mr-1"></i> (-1 point) means that this validator is in a&nbsp;data center
      with a&nbsp;high percent of the&nbsp;active stake.<br />
      If you are an&nbsp;investor who is delegating stake, please consider high performing nodes without a&nbsp;high data
      center concentration.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Authorized Withdrawer Score</strong><br />
      Validator identity matching authorized withdrawer is a security risk.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-minus-circle text-danger mr-1"></i> (-2 points) means that this validator identity is the same as the authorized withdrawer identity.<br />
      <i class="fas fa-circle score-0 mr-1"></i> (0 point) means that that this validator identity is different than the authorized withdrawer identity.<br />
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The maximum score is currently eleven (11) points:
    <i class="fas fa-circle score-2"></i>&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-circle score-2"></i>&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-circle score-2"></i>&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-circle score-2"></i>&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-circle score-2"></i>&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-circle score-1"></i>
  </p>
</div>

<h3 class="h5" id="data-centers">Data Centers</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  For the&nbsp;security reasons it is recommended that the&nbsp;validators in solana cluster are spread among as many
  locations as possible. It reduces the&nbsp;possibility of network collapse in case of a&nbsp;data center breakage.
  On our <%= link_to "data centers", data_centers_url(network: params[:network])%> page you can examine the&nbsp;validators
  distribution between data centers and organisations Autonomous System Numbers (ASN).
</p>

<hr />

<h2 class="mb-5">Dictionary</h2>

<h3 class="h5" id="commission">Commission</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  Commission is a&nbsp;percentage value set by a&nbsp;validator to&nbsp;determine how much of the&nbsp;rewards earned
  does it collect in order to&nbsp;incur the&nbsp;costs. It's automatically deducted from your rewards pay outs. It
  can be set anywhere between 0% and 100% and can be changed in any moment.
  <%= link_to "Click here", commission_histories_path(network: params[:network])%> if you want to&nbsp;know
  more about current commissions.
</p>

<h3 class="h5" id="epoch">Epoch</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  Time determined by number of slots, for which the&nbsp;leader schedule is valid.
</p>

<h3 class="h5" id="root-distance">Root Distance</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  Measures the&nbsp;median & average distance in block height between the&nbsp;validator and the&nbsp;tower's highest
  block. Smaller numbers mean that the&nbsp;validator is near the&nbsp;top of the&nbsp;tower.
</p>

<h3 class="h5" id="vote-distance">Vote Distance</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  Is very similar to the&nbsp;Root Block Distance score above. Lower numbers mean that the&nbsp;node is voting near
  the&nbsp;front of the group.
</p>

<h3 class="h5" id="skipped-vote">Skipped Slot&nbsp;&percnt;</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  Measures the&nbsp;percent of the&nbsp;time that a&nbsp;leader fails to&nbsp;produce a&nbsp;block during their allocated
  slots. A&nbsp;lower number means that the&nbsp;leader is making blocks at a&nbsp;very high rate.
</p>

<h3 class="h5" id="delinquency">Delinquency</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  If the&nbsp;validator is not active in the&nbsp;solana network it is considered to&nbsp;be delinquent. Short-time
  delinquencies are considered acceptable, since it occurs while software updates or temporary internet outages.
</p>

<h3 class="h5" id="stake-concentration">Stake Concentration</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  Solana is a&nbsp;decentralized proof-of-stake blockchain. It is best for the&nbsp;network and for those who uses it,
  that the&nbsp;total stake is divided among as many validators as possible. Keep this in&nbsp;mind while choosing
  a&nbsp;validator to delegate&nbsp;to.
</p>

<h5 id="stake-pool">Stake Pool</h5>
<p class="mb-5">
  Stake pools are an&nbsp;alternative method of&nbsp;earning staking rewards. This program allows SOL holders

<h2 id="questions" class="mb-5">FAQ</h2>

<h3 class="h5" id="new-validator">How to become a validator?</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  Please take a&nbsp;look at this detailed guide on Solana website:
  <%= link_to "https://docs.solana.com/running-validator", "https://docs.solana.com/running-validator" %>.
</p>

<h3 class="h5" id="personal-data">How is my Personal Data protected?</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  All Consumer Personal Information is encrypted in transit via HTTPS. You can see our secure certificate by
  clicking the&nbsp;lock icon in your browser location bar. We also encrypt all Personal Information at rest when it is
  stored within our database.
</p>

<h3 class="h5" id="private-validator">Why is my validator marked "private"?</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  It's based on commission rate. 100% commission means that you are not looking for delegations, so we mark you
  as "private". Private validators are always assigned with total score 0, despite their performance.
</p>

<h3 class="h5" id="withdraw-authority-warning">
  Why do I see <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle text-warning mx-1"></i> warning next to my validator?
</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  It informs visitors that your validator identity matches the&nbsp;withdraw authority on your vote account. It is
  a&nbsp;serious security risk, eg. if someone hacks into your validator, they can steal from the&nbsp;vote account.
  Keep the&nbsp;withdraw authority key offline to minimize the&nbsp;risk. Once you fix it, the&nbsp;warning will be
  taken off automatically within few hours.
</p>

<h3 class="h5" id="admin-warning">
  Why do I see <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle text-danger mx-1"></i> warning next to my validator?
</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  It informs visitors that validator's actions are malicious or harmful to the&nbsp;cluster. Hover your mouse over
  the&nbsp;warning symbol next to validator's name to see the&nbsp;details. Validators with red warnings are always
  assigned with total score 0, despite their performance.
</p>

<h3 class="h5" id="avatar">How can I change my avatar (validator logo)?</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  The images come from the&nbsp;validator's Keybase profile. Once you change it on Keybase, we'll update avatar in our
  system automatically within 24&nbsp;hours.
</p>


<h3 class="h5" id="investing">How do I start investing?</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  First, you'll need some SOLs. You can buy them on <%= link_to "Coinbase", "https://www.coinbase.com/" %>. Then send
  them to&nbsp;your web wallet, such as <%= link_to "Phantom", "https://phantom.app/" %> or
  <%= link_to "Solflare", "https://solflare.com/" %>. For other options check out
  <%= link_to "Solana web wallets", "https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/web-wallets" %> or

  page to&nbsp;find out what you should watch out for.
</p>

<h3 class="h5" id="change-validator">How often can I change the validator? Is there a minimum period?</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  It usually takes 1 epoch for stake to warm up or cool down. Try to split your stake across several validators. Please
  also read our advice on <%= link_to "how to choose the right validator", "#choosing-validator" %> and check out Solana
  <%= link_to "stake pool", "https://spl.solana.com/stake-pool/overview" %> program.
</p>

<h3 class="h5" id="staking-rewards">How often are the staking rewards paid out?</h3>
<p class="mb-5">
  It usually takes 1 epoch for stake to&nbsp;warm up or cool down. After that, you should see rewards in your wallet. For
  better results, try to&nbsp;split your stake across several validators. Please also read our advice on
